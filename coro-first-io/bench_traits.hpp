/** A concept for types that are executors.

    An executor is responsible for scheduling and running asynchronous
    operations. It provides mechanisms for symmetric transfer of coroutine
    handles and for queuing work items to be executed later.

    This concept requires that `T` is unambiguously derived from `any_executor`.
    The `any_executor` base class defines the interface that executors must
    implement: `dispatch()` for coroutine handles and `post()` for work items.

    @tparam T The type to check for executor conformance.

/** A concept for types that can allocate and deallocate memory for coroutine frames.

    Frame allocators are used to manage memory for coroutine frames, enabling
    custom allocation strategies such as pooling to reduce allocation overhead.

    Given:
    @li `a` a reference to type `A`
    @li `p` a void pointer
    @li `n` a size value (`std::size_t`)

    The following expressions must be valid:
    @li `a.allocate(n)` - Allocates `n` bytes and returns a pointer to the memory
    @li `a.deallocate(p, n)` - Deallocates `n` bytes previously allocated at `p`

    @tparam A The type to check for frame allocator conformance.

/** A concept for types that provide access to a frame allocator.

    Types satisfying this concept can be used as the first or second parameter
    to coroutine functions to enable custom frame allocation. The promise type
    will call `get_frame_allocator()` to obtain the allocator for the coroutine
    frame.
